# Documentation of steps in the development process

## - 1 creating the function
initially the function was created to check the factors of the number and append the relevant parts to the output, returning the values as appropriate
blockers - none


## - 2 creating input file
created an input file to allow use of the created function

blockers   - inputs are not always inputs - fixed with use of try:

## - 3 creating tests
created a file with several basic tests to see if the function worked as expected

blockers    - test didn't work with floats, rounded them instead of discarding - fixed by first casting as a string
            - test didn't work with output being returned initially - fixed by using print for the function

## - 4 improving input checking
wanted to have the function allow floats of the format 15.0 as 15, as this makes logical sense to do

blockers - file became bloated - abstracted the file to ensure it wasnt too heavy
        - test failed needs working on
